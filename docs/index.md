# ProcessingGdxAdapter

This project is a re-implementation of the Processing API on top of libgdx.
The goal is to be able to allow fully cross-platform development using the
Processing API (desktop, web, mobile).

The project is still in the early alpha stage.  A significant portion of the
Processing API is working (desktop and web tested only), but there are still
large parts missing.  The initial goal is to provide a reliable alternative to
processing.js to run Processing programs in the browser.
