# ProcessingGdxAdapter project notes



## Coordinate system

libgdx uses y-up, while Processing uses y-down.  
[stack overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7708379/changing-the-coordinate-system-in-libgdx-java)  

Can use OrthographicCamera in libgdx to switch.

```java
camera= new OrthographicCamera(Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight());
camera.setToOrtho(true, Gdx.graphics.getWidth(), Gdx.graphics.getHeight());
```

Textures need to be flipped as well:
```
String textureFile = "data/textures.txt";  
atlas = new TextureAtlas(Gdx.files.internal(textureFile), Gdx.files.internal("data"));  
// Let's flip all the regions.  Required for y=0 is TOP
Array<AtlasRegion> tr = atlas.getRegions();      
for (int i = 0; i < tr.size; i++) {
  TextureRegion t = tr.get(i);
  t.flip(false, true);
}
```

## Build

The subdirectories are each separate gradle projects.

The libgdx projects were generated by the `gdx-setup.sh` tool.  The command
line used is in _project-name_/`call-gdx-setup.sh`.  The generated projects use
gradle version 4.6.

I tried a gradle composite build, but this was not particularly convenient to
use; for now I'm using some command line scripts to handle dependency on the
ProcessingGdx library (jar).
