# ProcessingGdxAdapter project notes

The subdirectories are each separate gradle projects.

The libgdx projects were generated by the `gdx-setup.sh` tool.  The command
line used is in _project-name_/`call-gdx-setup.sh`.  The generated projects use
gradle version 4.6.

I tried a gradle composite build, but this was not particularly convenient to
use; for now I'm using some command line scripts to handle dependency on the
ProcessingGdx library (jar).
