# ProcessingGdxAdapter project notes



## Coordinate system

libgdx uses y-up, while Processing uses y-down.  
[stack overflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7708379/changing-the-coordinate-system-in-libgdx-java)  

Use `OrthographicCamera.setToOrtho(true)` to flip y-axis. 
```java
camera = new OrthographicCamera(width, height);
final boolean yDown = true;
camera.setToOrtho(yDown, width, height);
```
`ShapeRenderer` and `SpriteBatch` have method `setProjectionMatrix()`:
```java
shapeRenderer.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);
// ...
batch.setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);
```

## Build

The subdirectories are each separate gradle projects.

The libgdx projects were generated by the `gdx-setup.sh` tool.  The command
line used is in _project-name_/`call-gdx-setup.sh`.  The generated projects use
gradle version 4.6.

I tried a gradle composite build, but this was not particularly convenient to
use; for now I'm using some command line scripts to handle dependency on the
ProcessingGdx library (jar).
